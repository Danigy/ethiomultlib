**A Python library providing an implementation of the ancient Ethiopian Multiplication algorithm.**

This library offers a function, `ethiopian_multiplication`, to perform multiplication of two positive integers using the elegant and historically significant Ethiopian Multiplication method. This technique relies solely on doubling, halving (integer division), and addition. The method involves halving the first number and doubling the second number in parallel columns. Rows where the first number is odd contribute the corresponding second number to the final sum. This sum represents the product. It's a fascinating demonstration of binary arithmetic principles in a pre-modern algorithmic form, offering a unique perspective on arithmetic operations.

## Installation

```bash
pip install ethiomultlib
```

## Usage

```bash
import ethiomultlib

# Use the function from the library
result = ethiomultlib.ethiopian_multiplication(45, 12)
print(f"Result of Ethiopian Multiplication: {result}") # Output: 540
```
